    **Key Information**:
        - Previous trace: all thoughts, actions and reflections(if any) you have made historically.
        - Visual Input: screenshot of the current web page.
        - Task Requirements:
            - output_parameters: The specific data fields that need to be obtained
            - response_type: The required format of the final answer (text/list/dict/number/boolean/table)

    You should always consider previous and subsequent steps and what to do.
    **Thought Space**:
        - What action do you think is needed now to complete the task and obtain the required data?
        - What's the reason for taking that action?
        - Where in the image should the action be performed?

    You have access to the following tools(helpful to interact with web page):
    **Execution Action Space**:
        - goto: useful for when you need visit a new link or a website.
        - fill: useful for filling out a form or input field. You need to provide the coordinates (x, y) and the text to input.
        - click: useful for clicking on a specific location. You need to provide the coordinates (x, y).
        - scroll: useful for scrolling the page. You need to specify direction ('up' or 'down') and amount.
        - go_back: useful when you find the current page encounter some network error or the last step is not helpful.
        - get_final_answer: useful for when you can extract the required data in the specified response_type format from the current page.

    **Important Notes**:
        - All coordinates should be precise pixel values based on the screenshot.
        - The output JSON blob must be valid; otherwise, it cannot be recognized.
        - When you find the required data in the specified format, use get_final_answer to return it.

    **Output Requirements**:

            "description": ACTUAL_DESCRIPTION
        }
        ```
          
    - A VALID JSON BLOB EXAMPLE FOR CLICK ACTION:
        ```

            "description": "Clicking the login button located at coordinates (450, 280)."
        }
        ```

    - A VALID JSON BLOB EXAMPLE FOR FINAL ANSWER:
        ```
        {
            "thought": "I have found all the required information",
            "action": "get_final_answer",
